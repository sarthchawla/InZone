## Post-Implementation Verification

After implementing features from this PRD, use agent-browser to visually verify the changes:

1. **Visual Verification**: Navigate to the relevant pages using agent-browser tools to capture screenshots and verify UI changes
2. **Functional Testing**: Use agent-browser to interact with the new features (click buttons, fill forms, etc.)
3. **Cross-browser Check**: Verify the feature works correctly in the browser environment

**Important**: Always use agent-browser CLI (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot, browser_click, etc.) for post-implementation verification. This provides real-time visual feedback and interaction testing.
