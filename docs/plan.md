# Implementation Plan

## Overview
This file tracks the implementation tasks for Ralph to execute.
Ralph reads this file each iteration to find the next `pending` task.

## Task Status Legend
- `pending` - Ready to work on
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on
- `completed` - Successfully finished
- `failed` - Could not complete (see notes)
- `blocked` - Waiting on another task

## Notes for Ralph

1. **Always update this file** after completing or failing a task
2. **Work sequentially** - complete one task before starting the next
3. **Add notes** explaining what was done or why something failed
4. **Check dependencies** - some tasks may depend on others
5. **Signal completion** - when all tasks are done, output `RALPH_COMPLETE`
